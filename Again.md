In general when I read a book I want to move *somewhat* quickly to ensure I don't "give up" and lose momentum.

Here's a list of books I've already read but would like to revisit in a more relaxed way, generally so that I can read some of the linked texts in their bibliography or notes, or can review their subject matter in a way *beyond* the book itself:

* Ending Medical Reversal
* Algorithms to Live By
